# Welcome to my profile!

## I'm Peter ðŸ‘‹

I've got a website (made to practice React), which can be found [here](https://peterolsen1.github.io/).

<!-- I'm currently somewhere between 2 and 3 semesters from graduating with a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
I figured it's a good idea to upload all of my projects to GitHub so I can learn principles of version control, and so that those who so choose to can view them.

Last summer I finished working as a software development intern at __RAO manufacturing__, creating an internal use fullstack webapp to jumpstart the process of moving the company online. ðŸš€ðŸš€

 The purpose of this app was to ease the process of systematic data entry, speed up communication through automated email sending, present historical data in various different forms to allow for and aide complex data analysis, and to leverage use of machine learning in order to guide admintrative decisions.ðŸ’¡ -->

Last semester I completed many projects, among them were:

ðŸŒ± A social media site for plant owners (Stack: Flask, Jinja, PostgreSQL, PureCSS)

ðŸŽ¹ A site where musicians can store sheet music PDFs, and edit them on my very own homemade PDF drawing software! (Stack: Ember.js, Firebase)

ðŸ¤“ An AI analysis project where I explored optimizations to single-agent pathtinfing algorithms (Stack was just python)
  
## what am i up to now?

I have a few projects going on at the moment, including:
* A terminal based editor written in rust, called the PTE. (peter's text editor)
* A site where UMN students can easily host and sign up for office hours. Check it out <a href="https://gopher-hours.web.app">here!</a>
* An express like server-framework written in C. Not really for any purpose, mostly to just brush up on C skills.

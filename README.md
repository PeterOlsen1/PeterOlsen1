# Welcome to my profile!

## I'm Peter


I'm currnetly somewhere between 2 and 3 semesters from graduating with a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities

I figured it's a good idea to upload all of my projects to GitHub so I can have some sort of version control, and so that those who so choose to can view them

I'm currently working on my 'PlantProcessor' repo, which is a fullstack app where you can track data related to plants. My stack is a bit weird, but I'm just trying out new things to see what works.
```
Frontend: {css, Jinja, HTML, minimal JS templating}
Serverside: {Flask}
Databse: {MongoDB}
```

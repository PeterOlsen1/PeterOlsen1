# I'm Peter, welcome to my profile! 👋

I'm huge into learning by doing, and I hope that my github can reflect some of that. I also have a website, check it out [here](https://peterolsen1.github.io/)!

I'm currently in the midst of my first semester as a Master's student, during which I am taking courses on cloud computing, distributed systems, and software engineering.

For personal projects, I'm currently working on a mini implementation of redis, to enhance my system design and golang skills. I encourage everyone to go take a look at it in my pinned repositories.

# Welcome to my profile!

## I'm Peter

I have a newley published website (made to practice React), which can be found [here](https://peterolsen1.github.io/).

I'm currently somewhere between 2 and 3 semesters from graduating with a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
I figured it's a good idea to upload all of my projects to GitHub so I can learn principles of version control, and so that those who so choose to can view them.

I just finished working as a software development intern at __RAO manufacturing__, creating an internal use fullstack webapp to jumpstart the process of moving the company online. ðŸš€ðŸš€

The purpose of this app was to ease the process of systematic data entry, speed up communication through automated email sending, present historical data in various different forms to allow for and aide complex data analysis, and to leverage use of machine learning in order to guide admintrative decisions.ðŸ’¡

The stack was as follows:
```
frontend: {React, Sass, Chart.js, and some HTML, CSS, and JS/TS templating},
backend:  {
  web server: {Express.js},
  api server: {jBASE jAGENT},
  database:  {Pick OS => jBASE Basic}
}
```

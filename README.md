# Welcome to my profile!

## I'm Peter


I'm currnetly somewhere between 2 and 3 semesters from graduating with a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities

I figured it's a good idea to upload all of my projects to GitHub so I can have some sort of version control, and so that those who so choose to can view them

I'm currently working as a software development intern at RAO manufacturing, creating a fullstack webapp to jumpstart the process of moving the company online. ðŸš€ðŸš€

My stack is as follows:
`
frontend: {React, Sass, some JS/TS templating}
backend:  {
  web server: {Express},
  api server: {jBASE jAGENT},
  database:  {Pick OS => jBASE Basic}
`

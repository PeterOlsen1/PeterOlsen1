# Welcome to my profile!

### I'm Peter

I'm currnetly somewhere between 2 and 3 semesters from graduating with a degree in computer science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities
I figured it's a good idea to upload all of my projects to GitHub so I can have some sort of version control, and so that those who so choose to can view them.
I'm currently working on my 'PlantProcessor' repo, which is a fullstack app where you can track data related to plants
